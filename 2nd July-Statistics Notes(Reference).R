#Types of data
#Nominal - Does not have order but it is categorical. Ex: Yes/no, Gender, Country etc.
#Ordinal -  It has an order or rank. Ex:Likert scale, CGPA grading etc.
#Ratio - Parts
#Interval - Scaled data i.e between data ranges
#Numeric
#Categorical

#Measures of central tendency
#       Nominal Ordinal Interval  Ratio
#Mean       F     F       T         T
#Median     F     T       T         T
#Mode       T     T       T         T

#Here, interval and ratio are numbers so we can find all central tendencies.
#Nominal data we cant find mean and median because it has no order and though it is in category it wont make sense.
#Nominal data can have mode because most number of data can be identified.
#Ordinal data cant have mean because you cant find average of a scale/ranked data.
#Ordinal data has median and mode for the mid value and most occuring data respectively.
