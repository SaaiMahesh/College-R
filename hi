#Q1. Summary:
data()
#Dataset: Motor Trend Car Road Tests is the dataset that we're working with (mtcars)
#Description: The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).
#Format: A data frame with 32 observations on 11 (numeric) variables.
summary(mtcars)

#Q2. Is the avg mpg > 25?
#Statistical hypothesis testing using one sample t test
#Hypothesis question: Is the average mpg > 25?
#Null hypothesis(H0): Avg mpg is not > 25
#Alternative hypothesis(H1): Avg mpg is > 25
mean(mtcars$mpg)
skewness(mtcars$mpg) #Checking for skewness to determine if data is normal or not. Since it lies between -1 and +1, the data is not skewed and we can use parametric tests.
t.test(mtcars$mpg,alternative="greater",mu=25)
#Since p > 0.05, we accept null hypothesis i.e average mpg(miles per gallon) is not greater than 25.

#Q3. Find the relationship b/w variables
#Checking six different relationships between variables using correlation between -1 and +1 where lesser as the value goes lesser it has weak relationship and vice versa.
cor(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$cyl) #-0.852162 -> Strong Negative correlation hence when number of cylinders increases, the mileage per gallon decreases and vice versa.
cor(mtcars$disp,mtcars$hp) #0.7909486 -> Strong Positive correlation hence when horse power increases, the displacement increase and vice versa.
cor(mtcars$hp,mtcars$mpg) #-0.7761684 -> Strong Negative correlation hence when horse power increases, the mileage decreases and vice versa.
cor(mtcars$qsec,mtcars$hp) #-0.7082234 -> Strong Negative correlation hence when horse power increases, the quarter mile time decreases and vice versa.
cor(mtcars$gear,mtcars$hp) #-0.1257043 -> Weak Negative correlation hence when number of forward gears increase, there is a decrease in horsepower and vice versa.
cor(mtcars$wt,mtcars$mpg) #-0.8676594 -> Strong Negative correlation hence when the car's weight increases, there is a decrease in mileage per gallon and vice versa.
