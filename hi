#Q2. Is the avg mpg > 25?
#Statistical hypothesis testing using one sample t test
#Hypothesis question: Is the average mpg > 25?
#Null hypothesis(H0): Avg mpg is not > 25
#Alternative hypothesis(H1): Avg mpg is > 25
mean(mtcars$mpg)
skewness(mtcars$mpg) #Checking for skewness to determine if data is normal or not. Since it lies between -1 and +1, the data is not skewed and we can use parametric tests.
t.test(mtcars$mpg,alternative="greater",mu=25)
#Since p > 0.05, we accept null hypothesis i.e average mpg(miles per gallon) is not greater than 25.
